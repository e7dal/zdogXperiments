# zdogXperiments
experiments with zdog

I discovered Zdog in the beginning of june 2019 and I liked it immediately.
It's a really cool project, so I decided to make some experiments with it.
This github repository is the result of those experiments.
It's just the beginning, I have a lot of other ideas to test ;)

Note that for all shapes, it's possible to zoom with arrow keys, to reset the zoom with the escape key, and to "click & drag" to rotate the shape.

The content :

- Zdog Cube : cube generated programmatically, with two types of render : "wireframe" and "paint" (for the "paint" mode, colors are generated by Chroma.js)

- Zdog shapes : cube, sphere, icosahedron, pyramid, cylinder and cubo√Ød

- Zdog & obj files (wavefront) : cube, dodecahedron, icosahedron, and a lot of other objects, found on this site : http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/obj/obj.html

Note that the import OBJ algorithm is largely inspired by a similar algorithm found on Phoria.js, of Kevin Roast : http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/phoria/

- Menger Sponge : adaptation of an algorithm of Frido Verweij, you can see the original version here : https://library.fridoverweij.com/codelab/menger_fractals/menger_sponge_p5.html

- Tunnel 3D : shape generated using an algorithm of Niklas Knaack, found on this pen :  https://codepen.io/NiklasKnaack/pen/WyWqja
